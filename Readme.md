# Complex Networks
In the context of network theory, a complex network is a graph (network) with non-trivial topological features, features that do not occur in simple networks such as networks or random graphs, but often occur in graph modeling of real systems. 

# Code
Code implementation to calculate different measures to determine the structure of the network. Eigenvector, Clossenes, PAgeRank or Betweness are some of these metrics.
